I am a PhD student in Machine Learning in the [DATA Team](https://www.di.ens.fr/data/) at the [Centre de Sciences des Données](https://csd.ens.psl.eu/) (ENS, PSL University), advised by [Olivier Cappé](https://www.di.ens.fr/~cappe/) and [Alexandre Verine](https://www.alexverine.com/). My research focuses on robustness and privacy in generative models, with an emphasis on image generation. Previously, I studied computer science at the [IASD Master](https://www.masteriasd.eu/fr/) and physics at [ESPCI Paris-PSL](https://www.espci.psl.eu/fr/).
If you are interested in my research, you can find a complete list of my publications [here](./publications/).
