I am an MSc student in Machine Learning in the IASD Master of [PSL University](https://www.masteriasd.eu/en/). I am currently working at [ENS](https://csd.ens.psl.eu/) in the [DATA Team](https://www.di.ens.fr/data/) of the [Centre de Sciences des Données](https://csd.ens.psl.eu/) under the supervision of [Olivier Cappé]("https://www.di.ens.fr/~cappe/") and [Alexandre Verine]("https://www.alexverine.com/") on the intersection between generative models and reinforcement learning. Before that, I studied computer science, biotechnology and physics at [ESPCI Paris-PSL](https://www.espci.psl.eu/fr/).
If you are interested in my research, you can find a complete list of my publications [here](./publications/).
