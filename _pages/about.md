I am a MSc student in Machine Learning in the IASD Master from [PSL-Univeristy](https://www.masteriasd.eu/en/). I am currently working at [ENS](https://csd.ens.psl.eu/) in the Center for Data Science in Paris on the crossroads between generative models and reinforcement learning. Prior to that, I studied computer science, biotechnology and physics at [ESPCI Paris-PSL](https://www.espci.psl.eu/fr/).

If you are interested in my research, you can find a complete list of my publications [here](./publications/).
